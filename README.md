# Ambient EQ Tweak for Pixel 4 (Flame)

## Description
This Magisk Module aims to tweak Ambient EQ's values to mirror Apple's True Tone values. This can work on both the Pixel 4 (Flame) and Pixel 4 XL (Coral), but is mainly intended to work on Pixel 4, as the two phones use different panels. So YMMV.
The module has been updated to be compatible with more recent versions of Magisk, as the original module is not. Minimum Magisk Version is 20.0
